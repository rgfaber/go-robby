## Motivation
- As **a software engineer**
- I wish **to learn the golang language**
- For **fun and profit**

## Introduction

Do you remember "Robby the Robot"? "Go Robby" is a modern take on this classic exercise, that has served for so many as their first steps in computer science. The aim is to extend a little bit on this principle and create an event-sourced version with some extensions to the rules. Robots will move around in a finite, 3-dimensional playing field and have either a rock, paper or scissors as a weapon. Fighting it out in a "best-of-3" battle, the winner will gain some health points, whereas the loser will lose some. When 2 robots of the same kind encounter, they might procreate and produce offspring. Those are the basic rules of the game, let's learn Go!

## End Goal

The end goal of this exercise is 
- (a) to **learn golang** 
- (b) to **gain experience with architecture** in the context of a golang implementation
- (c) implement an **event-driven and -sourced application in golang**
- (d) maybe end up with a fun game

## Approach

- Since we have no experience to speak of at the start of this project, we will just play around in the [sandbox] first, before we try to make an actual first version.
